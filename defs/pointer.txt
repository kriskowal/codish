an [integer] that identifies a [memory] location.
unlike a [ref]erence, a pointer must be [transparent], so having a pointer means that you can do arithmetic on that pointer to find relative memory locations.
distinct: ref
aka: address
c++: a pointer and a reference are distinguished with different syntax, where a reference is an implicitly [deref]erenced pointer.
