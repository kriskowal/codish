reference.
a representation of a [integer] that identifies the location of an [object] in [memory].
a reference may be an [opaque] object, meaning that having a reference does not necessarily imply knowledge of the underlying [integer] value.
references may be [strong] or [weak] for purpose of [garbage collection], and may imply the location of supplementary data like a reference counter or [class] annotations.
