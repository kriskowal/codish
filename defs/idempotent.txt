(1.) of [unary function]s, converging on a [return] [value] when reapplied, as when the [return]ed value of one [application] is passed back as a [param]eter.
a [unary function], {{f}}, is idempotent [iff] {{f(x) [eq] f(f(x))}}.
(1.a.) an [attr]ibute of a [unary function] that denotes [whether] the [function] is idempotent for [all] [value]s in its [domain].
(2.) of [binary function]s, [return]ing the same [value] when that [value] is passed to both [param]eters.
a [value] is idempotent for a [binary function] [iff] {{f(x, x) [eq] x}}.
a [binary function], {{g}}, is idempotent [iff] {{f(x, x) [eq] x}} for all {{x}} in its domain.
(2.a.) a [binary function] that returns [whether] a particular [value] is idempotent for a given [binary function], meaning {{f(x, x) [eq] x}}.
(2.b.) an [attr]ibute of a [binary function] that denotes [whether] the [function] is idempotent for [all] [value]s in the [domain] of both [param]eters.
