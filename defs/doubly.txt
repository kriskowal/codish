pertains to [chain]s that have both [next] and [prev]ious [ref]erences in their [vertex]es.  doubly linked chains can be [cyclic]; if so, the [prev]ious [ref]erence of the [head] or [start] [vertex] [ref]ers to the [last] [vertex] in order.  a [cyclic] doubly linked [chain] may have a [head] node with no [value], such that an [empty] [chain] has a [head] [vertext] with both [next] and [prev]ious [ref]erences refering to itself.
