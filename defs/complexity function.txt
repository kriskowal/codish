a [relation] pertaining to [collection] [algorithm]s that has the character of the [relation] from the [number] of [value]s a [collection] [has] to the amount of [time] the [algorithm] will [run].  [complexity relation]s are normalized for quick comparison of the character of algorithms as the size of their collection increases by reducing all [add]itive constants and [mul]tiplicative factors to 1, and omitting logarithmic bases since all logarimic bases create curves that vary only by a multiplicative factor.
